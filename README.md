# AWS Basics – Completed Task

## 1. What is AWS?

Amazon Web Services (AWS) is a cloud computing platform provided by Amazon.
It offers on-demand computing resources like servers, storage, and databases.
Users can pay only for what they use without buying physical hardware.

## 2. Cloud Computing

Cloud computing means using internet-based resources instead of local servers.
It helps reduce infrastructure cost and improves scalability.
AWS provides public cloud services to individuals and companies.

## 3. AWS Global Infrastructure

AWS has Regions, Availability Zones (AZs), and Edge Locations.
A Region is a geographical area with multiple AZs.
This design ensures high availability and fault tolerance.

## 4. EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)

EC2 provides virtual servers to run applications.
Users can choose instance type, OS, CPU, and memory.
It supports scaling up or down based on requirement.

## 5. S3 (Simple Storage Service)

S3 is an object storage service used to store files and data.
It offers high durability and availability.
Commonly used for backups, media files, and logs.

## 6. IAM (Identity and Access Management)

IAM is used to manage users and permissions in AWS.
It allows secure access using roles, users, and policies.
Helps follow least privilege security principle.

## 7. RDS (Relational Database Service)

RDS provides managed relational databases like MySQL and PostgreSQL.
AWS handles backups, patching, and maintenance.
It supports high availability using Multi-AZ.

## 8. VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)

VPC allows you to create a private network in AWS.
You can control IP range, subnets, and routing.
It improves network security and isolation.

## 9. Security Groups

Security Groups act as virtual firewalls for EC2 instances.
They control inbound and outbound traffic.
Rules are defined based on ports and IPs.

## 10. Load Balancer

Load Balancer distributes traffic across multiple servers.
It improves application availability and performance.
AWS provides ALB, NLB, and CLB.

## 11. Auto Scaling

Auto Scaling automatically adjusts EC2 instances.
It helps handle traffic changes efficiently.
Ensures cost optimization and performance.

## 12. CloudWatch

CloudWatch is a monitoring service in AWS.
It collects metrics, logs, and alarms.
Used to track performance and system health.

## 13. Pricing Model

AWS follows a pay-as-you-go pricing model.
Users pay only for resources they use.
Helps reduce upfront infrastructure cost.

## 14. Advantages of AWS

Highly scalable and flexible platform.
Provides strong security and global reach.
Suitable for startups and enterprises.

## 15. Use Cases of AWS

Web hosting and application deployment.
Data backup and disaster recovery.
Big data, analytics, and machine learning.
